![Horror is queer theory; Deadites from Evil Dead _must_ be zombies right? Mommie's with the maggots now!](https://media.tenor.com/_NcBuTYrTmUAAAAC/mommys-with-the-maggots-with-the-maggots-now.gif)

# Challenges!

## I forgot to include my challenges during my first push, that's a challenge no? I had no difficulties working out the questions if I'm being honest.

## My YAML header as always could be formatted better, not the hugest fan of the `readthedown` format if only because it negates `toc:` 

## I think my comments could be better, and more consistent. But, also everything can always be better.

## I struggled with figuring out how I wanted to assess distributions. I broke out `ks.test()` but I'm certain I could have worked out an iterative algorithm or something from my computational statistics days.

## In general, I think I could have formatted my document to be prettier in numerous ways (e.g., using HTML code) but I don't think that's necessary for this document.

# Questions

## Libraries

```{r, libs, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(rmdformats)
library(curl)
```

## Question 1

First we must load in the data!

```{r, data_init}
zombies <- read_csv(curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall23/zombies.csv")); head(zombies) # gender here is slaying, first time nbs have had any rep in the gender variable in most datasets ever
```

```{r, popmeans}
# going variable by variable finding means
pop_height_mean <- mean(zombies$height); pop_height_mean
pop_weight_mean <- mean(zombies$weight); pop_weight_mean
pop_zkills_mean <- mean(zombies$zombies_killed); pop_zkills_mean
pop_yrsedu_mean <- mean(zombies$years_of_education); pop_yrsedu_mean
pop_age_mean <- mean(zombies$age); pop_age_mean
```

```{r, popvariances}
pop_var <- function(data){ # we're making a population variance function
  # the math works out here
  var(data) * ((length(data) - 1)/(length(data)))
}
# going variable by variable again
pop_height_var <- pop_var(zombies$height); pop_height_var
pop_weight_var <- pop_var(zombies$weight); pop_weight_var
pop_zkills_var <- pop_var(zombies$zombies_killed); pop_zkills_var
pop_yrsedu_var <- pop_var(zombies$years_of_education); pop_yrsedu_var
pop_age_var <- pop_var(zombies$age); pop_age_var
```

## Question 2

```{r, boxplots}
# ggplot by each variable
# gender/sex is more real thank you very much (but also I hate the term)

zombies %>% ggplot(aes(x = height, color = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Height by gender/sex")

zombies %>% ggplot(aes(x = weight, color = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Weight by gender/sex")

zombies %>% ggplot(aes(x = zombies_killed, color = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Zombies killed by gender/sex")

zombies %>% ggplot(aes(x = zombies_killed, color = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Zombies killed by gender/sex")

zombies %>% ggplot(aes(x = years_of_education, color = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Years of education by gender/sex")

zombies %>% ggplot(aes(x = age, color = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Age by gender/sex")
```

## Question 3

```{r, scatterplots}
# tried using size and color, looks horrendous i'm ngl
zombies %>% ggplot(aes(x = age, y = weight, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle("Age and weight")

zombies %>% ggplot(aes(x = age, y = height, color = gender)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle("Age and height")

zombies %>% ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = height, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle("Age and height")
```

There seems to be a linear relationship between height and age, and a fairly weak relationship between weight and age. The strongest linear relationship is between height and weight.

## Question 4

We're going to look at normality, variable by variable!

### Height

```{r, height}
# going to be making ugly plots
hist(zombies$height)
qqnorm(zombies$height)
# it looks normal!
```

### Weight

```{r, weight}
hist(zombies$weight)
qqnorm(zombies$weight)
# it looks approximately normal
```

### Zombies Killed

```{r}
hist(zombies$zombies_killed)
qqnorm(zombies$zombies_killed)
# this is not normal
# i think this is poisson
# i'm breaking out kolmogorov smirnov
ks.test(zombies$zombies_killed, "ppois", pop_zkills_mean)
```

This is probably poisson distributed!

### Years of education

```{r}
hist(zombies$years_of_education)
qqnorm(zombies$years_of_education)
# this is not normal
# i think its poisson
# i'm breaking out ks again
ks.test(zombies$years_of_education, "ppois", pop_yrsedu_mean)
```

This is probably poisson distributed!

### Age

```{r, age}
hist(zombies$age)
qqnorm(zombies$age)
# this looks approximately normal
```

## Question 5

```{r, sampling}
set.seed(812) # it's my birthday I'm a narcissist
zombie_height <- sample(zombies$height, 30, replace = F)
zombie_weight <- sample(zombies$weight, 30, replace = F)
zombie_age <- sample(zombies$age, 30, replace = F)
zombie_years_of_education <- sample(zombies$years_of_education, 30, replace = F)
zombie_zkills <- sample(zombies$zombies_killed, 30, replace = F)
```

We're going to construct t intervals for all these samples! I've personally never used a normal assumption except for binomial proportions (because the math just so happens to work out that way).

```{r, height_interval}
# height, copying and pasting an old code snippet
LB_height <- mean(zombie_height) - 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_height)) * sqrt(var(zombie_height)/length(zombie_height)));LB_height
UB_height <- mean(zombie_height) + 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_height)) * sqrt(var(zombie_height)/length(zombie_height)));UB_height
```

```{r, weight_interval}
# weight, copying and pasting 
LB_weight <- mean(zombie_weight) - 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_weight)) * sqrt(var(zombie_weight)/length(zombie_weight)));LB_weight
UB_weight <- mean(zombie_weight) + 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_weight)) * sqrt(var(zombie_weight)/length(zombie_weight)));UB_weight
```

```{r, zkills_interval}
# zkills, copying and pasting
LB_zkills <- mean(zombie_zkills) - 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_zkills)) * sqrt(var(zombie_zkills)/length(zombie_zkills)));LB_zkills
UB_zkills <- mean(zombie_zkills) + 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_zkills)) * sqrt(var(zombie_zkills)/length(zombie_zkills)));UB_zkills
```


```{r, age_interval}
# height, copying and pasting our old 
LB_age <- mean(zombie_age) - 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_age)) * sqrt(var(zombie_age)/length(zombie_age)));LB_age
UB_age <- mean(zombie_age) + 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_age)) * sqrt(var(zombie_age)/length(zombie_age)));UB_age
```

```{r, education_interval}
# height, copying and pasting our old 
LB_years_of_education <- mean(zombie_years_of_education) - 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_years_of_education)) * sqrt(var(zombie_years_of_education)/length(zombie_years_of_education)));LB_years_of_education
UB_years_of_education <- mean(zombie_years_of_education) + 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_years_of_education)) * sqrt(var(zombie_years_of_education)/length(zombie_years_of_education)));UB_years_of_education
```

## Question 6

Create the data...

```{r, forloops4dayz}
set.seed(812) # it's my birthday!!! again!!!
# i was gonna do for loops but i couldn't be bothered
zombie_height <- replicate(100, mean(sample(zombies$height, 30, replace = F)))
zombie_weight <- replicate(100, mean(sample(zombies$weight, 30, replace = F)))
zombie_age <- replicate(100, mean(sample(zombies$age, 30, replace = F)))
zombie_years_of_education <- replicate(100, mean(sample(zombies$years_of_education, 30, replace = F)))
zombie_zkills <- replicate(100, mean(sample(zombies$zombies_killed, 30, replace = F)))
```

...Now lets compare confidence intervals!

```{r, height_interval2}
# height, copying and pasting an old code snippet
LB_height <- mean(zombie_height) - 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_height)) * sqrt(var(zombie_height)/length(zombie_height)));LB_height
UB_height <- mean(zombie_height) + 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_height)) * sqrt(var(zombie_height)/length(zombie_height)));UB_height
```

```{r, weight_interval2}
# weight, copying and pasting 
LB_weight <- mean(zombie_weight) - 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_weight)) * sqrt(var(zombie_weight)/length(zombie_weight)));LB_weight
UB_weight <- mean(zombie_weight) + 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_weight)) * sqrt(var(zombie_weight)/length(zombie_weight)));UB_weight
```

```{r, zkills_interval2}
# zkills, copying and pasting
LB_zkills <- mean(zombie_zkills) - 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_zkills)) * sqrt(var(zombie_zkills)/length(zombie_zkills)));LB_zkills
UB_zkills <- mean(zombie_zkills) + 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_zkills)) * sqrt(var(zombie_zkills)/length(zombie_zkills)));UB_zkills
```


```{r, age_interval2}
# age, copying and pasting our old 
LB_age <- mean(zombie_age) - 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_age)) * sqrt(var(zombie_age)/length(zombie_age)));LB_age
UB_age <- mean(zombie_age) + 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_age)) * sqrt(var(zombie_age)/length(zombie_age)));UB_age
```

```{r, education_interval2}
# education, copying and pasting our old 
LB_years_of_education <- mean(zombie_years_of_education) - 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_years_of_education)) * sqrt(var(zombie_years_of_education)/length(zombie_years_of_education)));LB_years_of_education
UB_years_of_education <- mean(zombie_years_of_education) + 
  (qt(0.975, df = length(zombie_years_of_education)) * sqrt(var(zombie_years_of_education)/length(zombie_years_of_education)));UB_years_of_education
```

\
\
The means are the same, but the spread is much smaller (because it's a sampling distribution!)
\
\
Histograms?

```{r, hists}
hist(zombie_height)
hist(zombie_weight)
hist(zombie_age)
hist(zombie_zkills)
hist(zombie_years_of_education)

qqnorm(zombie_height)
qqnorm(zombie_weight)
qqnorm(zombie_age)
qqnorm(zombie_zkills)
qqnorm(zombie_years_of_education)
```

The poisson data is looking _more_ normal but to call it normal would definitely be a reach. Imagine replicating 1000 times!
